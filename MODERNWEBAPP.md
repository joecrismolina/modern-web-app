## Introduction

In the beginning, creating websites/web applications, consisted of HTML pages, a dash of CSS and some sprinkles of Javascript. But people wanted the websites to look more appealing and flashy, so they added heaps and heaps of CSS and Javascript. But alas!, they were not contented and wanted their websites and web applications to not just be visually appealing but more interactive and dynamic, and so they added tons more of Javascript. This gave rise to *Javascript Frameworks*. First, jQuery, then Angular, Ember, then React, and then Vue, Svelte, and... they keep on coming and coming, and now everyone's lost and just want to go back to the good old days of `document.querySelectorAll()` (or not Lols). You get the basic picture right?

In summary, we have a very complex and rich Javascript frameworks and ecosystem right now and these frameworks come and go sometimes faster than you can master any of them. But these frameworks are just *toolings to help developers be more productive*. In the end, they will all come down to HTML, CSS and Javascript asset files that you will need to serve to your clients.

The goal, is to somehow help us understand, how we get from point A (complex Front End framework) to point B (final HTML, CSS and Javascript assets).

## Structure

For the project, we will create a simple project structure as follows

```javascript
/root
    /dist
    /src
        index.html
        index.js
        /js
```

## Modern Javascript

## Webpack

## Babel

## Let's Create a React Application, without using create-react-app!
